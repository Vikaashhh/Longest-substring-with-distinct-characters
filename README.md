# 📅 Day 58 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔍 Problem: Longest Substring with Distinct Characters
### 🧠 Difficulty: Medium
### 📌 Tags: #Day58 #gfg160 #geekstreak2025
### 🚀 Status: Solved in 1 Attempt ✅

## 📋 Problem Statement:
Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains all distinct characters.

## ⚙️ Approach Used: Sliding Window + Hash Map
### 💡 Insight:
We leveraged a dynamic sliding window and a dictionary (last_seen) to efficiently track character positions and update the start index when duplicates were encountered.

## 📊 Submission Summary:
- ✅ Test Cases Passed: 1111 / 1111

- 🧪 Accuracy: 100%

- ⏱️ Time Taken: 0.12 sec

- 🏆 Points Scored: 4 / 4

- 📈 Total Score: 213

## 🔎 Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n) – Each character is processed at most twice.

- Space Complexity: O(1) (since character set is limited to ASCII or lowercase/uppercase letters)

## 🌱 Key Takeaway:
Mastered a fundamental string problem using a clean and optimal pattern. This pattern is pivotal for solving real-world issues like token parsing, streaming data validation, or cursor-based search queries. 🔍
